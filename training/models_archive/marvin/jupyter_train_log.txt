WARNING:tensorflow:From /data_fast/storage/cstollen/vedliot/projects/secure-microphone/training/tensorflow/tensorflow/examples/speech_commands/models.py:737: calling dropout (from tensorflow.python.ops.nn_ops) with keep_prob is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:
Please use `rate` instead of `keep_prob`. Rate should be set to `rate = 1 - keep_prob`.

Instructions for updating:
Use tf.where in 2.0, which has the same broadcast rule as np.where
